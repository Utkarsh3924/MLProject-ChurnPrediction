# MLProject-ChurnPrediction
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to customers who stop using a company's products or services. It's essentially customer turnover. This is a critical metric for businesses, especially those with subscription-based models, as losing customers can significantly impact revenue and growth.<br>
Project Description-
 - Identified and gathered customer data relevant to churn (e.g., demographics, purchase history, support interactions).Explored and cleaned the data to ensure quality for model training.
 - Created new features from existing data that might improve model performance. Standardized and transformed data for model compatibility.
 - Trained various machine learning classification models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict churn. Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Compared and selected the best performing model.
 - Integrated the chosen model into a production environment for real-time predictions. Monitored model performance and retrained periodically to maintain accuracy.
